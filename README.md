ATMEGA328 is a high-performance, low-power Microchip 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1KB EEPROM, 2KB SRAM, 54/69 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, a JTAG interface for boundary-scan and on-chip debugging/programming, three flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts,serial programmable USART, a universal serial interface (USI) with start condition detector, an 8-channel 10-bit A/D converter, programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, SPI serial port, and five software selectable power saving modes. The device operates between 1.8-5.5 volts. By executing powerful instructions in a single clock cycle, the device achieves throughputs approaching 1 MIPS per MHz, balancing power consumption and processing speed.
